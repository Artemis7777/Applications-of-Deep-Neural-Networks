    "* **encode_text_index** - Encode text fields, such as the iris species as a single numeric field as \"0\" \"1\" and \"2\".  Encode the target field for a classification this way.  Good for nominal.\n",

This number of steps that early stopping will tolerate no improvement is called *patience*.  If the patience value is large, the neural network's error may continue to worsen while early stopping is patiently waiting.  At some point earlier in the training the optimal set of weights was obtained for the neural network.  However, at the end of training we will have the weights for the neural network that finally exhausted the patience of early stopping.  The weights of this neural network might not be bad, but it would be better to have the most optimal weights during the entire training operation.  \n",

Once training is done, we just reload this file and we have the optimal training weights that were found.\n",
